# Node Exporter Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and configure Node Exporter for Prometheus monitoring on your system.

1. Change to the temporary directory:
   ```
   cd /tmp
   ```

2. Install the wget package using yum:
   ```
   yum install wget -y
   ```

3. Download the Node Exporter release tarball:
   ```
   wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v0.18.1/node_exporter-0.18.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

4. List the contents of the directory to verify the downloaded file:
   ```
   ll
   ```

5. Extract the tarball contents:
   ```
   tar xvfz node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

6. List the contents of the directory again to check the extracted files:
   ```
   ll
   ```

7. Move the Node Exporter binary to the /usr/local/bin/ directory:
   ```
   sudo mv node_exporter-*.*-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/
   ```

8. Create a system user for Node Exporter:
   ```
   sudo useradd -rs /bin/false node_exporter
   ```

9. Open the Node Exporter systemd service file in the vi editor:
   ```
   sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
   ```

   Add the following content to the file:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Node Exporter
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter

   [Install]
   WantedBy=default.target
   ```

   Save and exit the editor.

10. Reload the systemd daemon to load the new service configuration:
    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

11. Enable Node Exporter to start on system boot:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
    ```

12. Start the Node Exporter service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl start node_exporter
    ```

13. Check the status of the Node Exporter service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status node_exporter
    ```

Once you have completed these steps, Node Exporter should be installed and running on your system, 
ready to be scraped by Prometheus for monitoring purposes.
```
