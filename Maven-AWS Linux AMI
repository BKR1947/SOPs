Steps to install maven on AWS - EC2 - Amazon Linux

-> Launch an EC2 with below AMI 

  id: ami-09f7fbc41963e146f
  name : amzn2-ami-kernel-5.10-hvm-2.0.20230404.0-x86_64-gp2
  
-> install the OpenJDK (Java Development Kit) version 1.8.0

  # sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
  
-> Check java version

  # java -version
  
-> switch to /opt (optional)

  # cd /opt/
  
-> use the "wget" utility to download Apache Maven from the official website

  # wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.8/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.8-bin.zip
  
-> unzaip downloaded zip file

  # unzip apache-maven-3.8.8-bin.zip
  
-> rename unzaip file (optional)

  # mv apache-maven-3.8.8 maven
  
-> switch to maven/

  # cd maven/
  
-> switch to profile.d

  # cd /etc/profile.d/
  
-> Create a new file for maven script

  # vim maven.sh
  
  press 'i' and you will be in insert mode
  copy paste below contents 

   export M2_HOME=/opt/maven 
   export PATH=${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

  press 'esc' and shift+zz

(First line sets an environment variable named "M2_HOME" and assigns it the value "/opt/maven". Environment variables are used to store configuration 
information that can be accessed by various programs running on a system. In this case, "M2_HOME" is set to the installation directory of Maven. 
Second line ine appends the "bin" directory of the Maven installation directory to the "PATH" environment variable. The "PATH" variable is used by the 
system to locate executable files, and adding Maven's "bin" directory to the "PATH" allows you to run Maven commands from any location in the command 
line without specifying the full path to the Maven executable. The "${M2_HOME}/bin" part of the line expands to the Maven installation directory followed 
by "/bin", and the "${PATH}" part appends the existing "PATH" value to it)
  
-> modify the permissions of the "maven.sh" file to allow all users to have full read, write, and execute permissions

   change mode = chmod : In Linux, file permissions are represented by a three-digit number, where each digit represents the permissions for the owner, 
   group, and others, respectively. The digits can have values ranging from 0 to 7, with each value representing a different set of permissions: 0 (---) 
   means no permissions, 7 (rwx) means full permissions, and values in between represent combinations of read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions. 
   In this case, "777" means that the file will have full permissions for all users, including the owner, group, and others.

  # chmod 777 maven.sh

-> execute the commands and set the environment variables defined in the "maven.sh" file in the current shell session

  # source maven.sh
  
-> Check and confirm maven installation

  # mvn --version
